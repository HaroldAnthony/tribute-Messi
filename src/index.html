        The whole purpose behind the creation of this heavily-bootstrapped
        webpage, and the crazy mind behind all this glazing.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        <strong>SHORT STORY</strong> - I'm a college graduate, looking for an
        excuse to sharpen my Bootstrap skills (just effective copy-pasting).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>LONG STORY</strong> - I've been crazy about football since 2011,
        and being an ardent follower of <strong>FC Barcelona</strong> sucks, atleast in 2024.
        What sucks even more is the fact that I'm not able to land a job, maybe
        because it is 2024. But hey, my favourite footballer just completed a
        three-peat of major international trophies, so it's not that bad. Well,
        it's not like he's aging backward, and he might retire before the
        potential <strong><em>Finalissima</em></strong> clash with Boy Wonder
        Lamine Yamal and the <strong><em>La Roja</em></strong
        >. But again, I'm going through a lot of emotions, and this site is
        where all the rambling will go on.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong><em>Blaugrana</em></strong> just aren't the same without
        their all-time top scorer, who left amidst the club's financial trouble
        (and apparently, because of it!). Laporta did return as club president,
        and a plethora of big free agent signings did follow, but we still
        unearthed a lot of <strong><em>La Masia</em></strong> gems in the
        process. The latest one is the aforementioned Boy Wonder Lamine Yamal
        (that's how I'll keep calling him), but others have contributed greatly
        as well, including Fermín López, who was part of the
        <strong>UEFA EURO</strong> 2024 winning squad with Yamal, and Pau
        Cubarsí, who missed out. If I can include EURO-winning La Masia
        graduates who don't play for FC Barcelona, namely Marc Cucurella, Dani
        Olmo, and Alex Grimaldo (who was nowhere to be seen at the Euro, but had
        a fantastic season with <strong>Bayer Neverlusen</strong>), it is
        self-explanatory that La Masia is still the best at what it does. But
        the youth academy's greatest graduate is still greatly missed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Argentina got to keep hold of their captain for longer, and
        coincidentally, it was after his last-ever game with FC Barcelona that
        he finally got to win international trophies. Maybe it was meant to be
        that way, starting with the 2021 <strong>Copa América</strong>, and
        moving on to the 2022 FIFA World Cup and the 2024 Copa América,
        completing the international three-peat. 2021 saw Argentina's capitán
        finally shrug off the criticism that he couldn't win big with the
        <strong><em>La Albiceleste</em></strong
        >, and that he always felt Catalan instead. Winning the oldest
        still-running continental football competition at the Maracanã, against
        fierce rivals Brazil, felt like destiny, although this was just the
        start. He would go on to be the best player of the 2022 World Cup, apart
        from being the winning captain, and whilst 2024's Copa América didn't go
        as well stat-wise, the team won gold again, and gave him perhaps his
        last hurrah.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><em>"La Pulga"</em></strong> currently plies his trade at Inter
        Miami CF, which is the newest holiday destination for his Barcelona
        comrades Luis Suárez, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba. I didn't bother
        watching him in PSG, his next club after getting discarded from
        <strong><em>Barça</em></strong
        >, simply because I couldn't see him in in another club jersey than the
        accustomed <strong>blue and garnet</strong>. It must be pretty clear by
        now that I didn't watch him in pink as well, rather choosing to recover
        all that lost sleep over the years. His <strong>Sorare</strong> scores
        were still amazing, but he missed a handful of games, owing to fatigue
        and injury problems, which did prove that he was just as human like most
        post-prime footballers. Atleast I thought so, because watching him still
        reminds of yesteryear glimpses - the passing, the created chances, the
        occasional dribbles, and that damned walking. He's still the greatest of
        all time, albeit the grayed hairs.
      </p>
      <p>
        This wannabe web application is going to be all about THAT sportsperson,
        and why I've been amazed by watching his magic unfold (no pun intended).
