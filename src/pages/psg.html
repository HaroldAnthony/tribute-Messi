              MNM - Mbappe, Neymar and Messi. The deadliest trio in football was
              formed, atleast on paper, when the Argentine joined <b>PSG</b>.
              But how the hell did Messi decide to wear a shirt other than the
              striped <b>Blaugrana</b>?
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              Well, <b>FC Barcelona</b>'s financial troubles meant they couldn't
              renew the contract of their biggest star, who was set to stay. It
              was also reported that he was open to a big paycut, because he
              wasn't ready to prepare an emotional final speech. But hey,
              football can be cruel sometimes, but atleast he was signed by a
              club who doubled his weekly wages. He got to play with
              <b>Neymar</b> again, who powers of persuasion paid off. He started
              dreaming of winning the <b>UEFA Champions League</b> again, which
              was long overdue. With possibly the best third musketeer in
              <b>Kylian Mbappe</b>, and yet another
              <b>summer transfer window</b> of blockbuster signings, the dream
              was realistic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Messi in Paris was supposed to be a fairytale, but it never got to
              be written that way. Life after Barcelona was always bound to be
              hard, but it turned out to be on a higher difficulty mode. A poor
              first season by his standards, even though it was a good season
              for humanly standards, Messi just couldn't do it. In
              <b>Ligue 1</b>, he did have his moments, but on the biggest stage,
              the Champions League, he couldn't spew magic like he used to. This
              didn't go well with the fans, and Messi's deteriorating
              relationship the <b>ultras</b> didn't help either. The greatest
              footballer in the modern era was being booed.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second season was much better for Leo, but continental success
              still eluded PSG. The club didn't sign Messi for
              <b>domestic dominance</b> - they were already good in that, for
              years since the <b>Qatari takeover</b>. They wanted the UCL, to
              validate a long-term sporting project with enormous investment
              involved. Instead, they got Messi and former on-field rival/now
              teammate <b>Sergio Ramos</b> getting all cuddly. A
              <b>"Saudi trip"</b> on working days was all that Messi had to do,
              to sever ties with the club. A suspension followed, and pretty
              soon, another ugly exit.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lionel Messi's greatest achievement, whilst being a PSG player,
              was not at all related to the club at all. He got to win the World
              Cup, which surely cemented his place among the greats. His move to
              PSG initially meant that he could face his former club,<b
                >"Broke Barça"</b
              >, at the Champions League. But as destiny would have it, in both
              seasons Messi played for PSG, FC Barcelona would not make it to
              the <b>round of 16</b> - they had to worry about the
              <b>UEFA Europa League</b> instead, a new low for them. PSG didn't
              even make it to the same group as FCB in those 2 seasons, although
              <b>Bayern Munich</b> got that wish fulfilled, much to the dismay
              of the <b>culers</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the difficult stay in France, and winning
              <b>football's greatest prize</b>, Messi decided to put family
              first, and seeked a new destination that made things easy. A
              return to FC Barcelona, although dreamy, was completely out of
              reach. <b>Al Hilal</b> had the opportunity to recreate a
              <b>club rivalry</b>, pitting Messi against <b>Al Nassr</b>'s
              <b>Cristiano Ronaldo</b>. But Lionel Messi chose another
              destination, which wasn't unexpected, but yeah, his time at
              <b>Europe</b> was done and dusted. He was finally the GOAT,
              football's <b>most decorated player</b>, and he deserved some
              rest.

              Yeah, these stats seem pretty good for the average footballer. But
              hey, since this is Lionel Messi the Alien we're dealing with, it's
              pretty obvious that he couldn't reach the standards he himself
              set, for an entire decade of ridiculous stats that seemed humanly
              impossible.

              Winning the league title in both seasons isn't really that big of
              an achievement for the cash-rich club. Zero Champions League
              titles won during Project Champions League led to the disbanding
              of the MNM trio. Even the wealthy Qatari ownership couldn't create
              an MSN regen, let alone a decent side that could actually win the
              <b>Ol’ Big Ears</b>.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              Honestly, I've never watched a single game where Messi played for
              PSG, except his debut match (which was heartbreaking for the culer
              me). I've made sure to remain unbiased in my perspective of
              Messi's PSG stint, and I did watch his highlights regularly. His
              <b>OPTA</b>-based scores were amazing in <b>Sorare</b>, which went
              on to prove that he was still good at what he did - play with the
              ball.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              <p>In an ideal world, Messi to PSG shouldn't have happened.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              He was ready to stay at FC Barcelona, reportedly accepting a 50%
              paycut, which was huge for someone of his caliber. His family was
              well-settled in the Catalan city, and Messi never really wanted to
              leave the club of his life (except in 2020, with the whole
              <b>burofax</b> fiasco). The Blaugrana geared up for the
              announcement of the much-expected renewal, but overnight, things
              changed dramatically. The renewal was impossible, and clubs
              swarmed Messi like vultures, although most of them couldn't really
              afford him. Most clubs, although one club was always the actual
              favourite - <b>Manchester City</b>. Messi was already linked with
              City twice, in 2016 (due to the <b>tax evasion</b> controversy),
              and in 2020, after the aforementioned burofax incident. Messi did
              have talks with <b>Pep Guardiola</b>, excited to join hands with
              his former manager at <b>Barça</b>. I too feel that Manchester
              City would have been a better destination, and these are my
              arguments -
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The <b>Premier League</b> is the most attractive top-flight
                league, ranked first by <b>UEFA</b> and being the most-watched
                league in the world.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Messi-Guardiola faction already yielded 14 trophies,
                including two Champions Leagues, and forming arguably the best
                footballing side of all time.
              </li>
              <li>
                Manchester City under Guardiola was a strict team system, with
                no place for individual shenanigans like at PSG. Messi's job
                would have been much easier in Guardiola's system.
              </li>
              <li>
                It would have been the perfect excuse to finally learn English.
                Sure, the weather and cuisine aren't the best, but a large part
                of Messi's global fanbase doesn't really understand what he
                speaks, without subtitles to save the day.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Yes, PSG made it to the UCL final in 2019/20. Neymar and Messi's
              reunion got a lot of people excited. Messi's second season was
              actually pretty good in terms of numbers. But, there's a lot of
              reasons that claim otherwise - the PSG transfer didn't really work
              out. His family had a hard time in France and he couldn't get the
              hero's welcome after winning the World Cup - Argentina beat France
              in the final, so a lot of fans were pissed back at the French
              capital. Besides, he didn't have the influence he enjoyed at
              Barça, let alone the love and the adoration.
