              At the start of the new milennium, FC Barcelona official Charly
              Rexach pulled off the greatest club signing ever - an Argentine,
              who became the club's greatest player and arguably, the greatest
              in football itself.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              The kit number 10 has always been a topic of fascination at FC
              Barcelona. The impact of Blaugrana’s legendary players who donned
              the number deserves a separate article of its own. The Hungarian
              refugee Lazlow Kubala, of the early years. The original Luis
              Suarez (not to be confused with the Uruguayan biter/2015-16
              European Golden Boot winner). A random Argentine named Diego
              Maradona. An entire Brazilian carnival float carrying Romario,
              Rivaldo and Ronaldinho. But none of them made the #10 special as
              much as a little kid with growth hormone deficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
              He was 13 when he first arrived at the Catalan city. The move had
              famously materialized on a napkin, when FC Barcelona agreed to
              support a small-statured Lionel Messi with the needed medical
              treatment. The club had faced turbulent times in the recent past,
              but Joan Laporta was the new club president now. New signing
              Ronaldinho brought hope to the ardent culers. The Dutchman Frank
              Rijkaard was at the helm. The club’s wonder years would soon
              begin, but the final piece was Messi. He took little time to be
              promoted to the senior team, grabbing eyeballs right from the
              start. He formally announced himself on a preseason friendly
              against Juventus, when manager Fabio Capello reportedly enquired
              about a possible loan move involving Messi. But no, that name was
              destined to be chanted at the Camp Nou for many years to come.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was the 2006/07 season, right after Champions League glory,
              that Leo Messi caught the attention of the world, courtesy of two
              iconic moments. One was the Maradona-esque goal against Getafe
              (yes, THAT GOAL. The one that goes by “Ankara Messi”). The other
              moment was when the 19-year-old Argentine scored his first
              hattrick against Real Madrid, in the El Clasico. Individually, he
              was beaming, but the club environment wasn’t all that positive.
              The board knew that things had to change, and they couldn’t let
              Messi get affected by all that. Pep Guardiola, a familiar face,
              entered the scene as manager, while Ronaldinho was shown the door
              out. The new manager changed the team structure and made sure that
              the new system was built around Lionel Messi, who was offered the
              number 10, and the rest was history.
            </p>
            <p>
              The 2008/09 season became the most successful season for FC
              Barcelona, winning the sextuple i.e., every possible trophy. Messi
              perfected the “false nine” position, pulling the strings of an
              inspirational attack, that formed what many consider to be
              arguably the greatest team in football history. What followed was
              a very successful tenure for Guardiola, and La Pulga thrived under
              him. 4 goals on a UCL night against Arsenal, toying with
              Manchester United at the 2011 Champions League Final, inspiring a
              treble-winning 2010/11 season, 91 goals in 2012 alone, winning a
              record 4 Ballon d’ors by the age of 25 – Leo Messi was certainly
              inhuman. Even after Pep Guardiola left the club, Messi continued
              to influence Barca’s attack with fellow comrades Xavi and Iniesta,
              although a lot rested on the Argentine’s efficiency and
              effectiveness. The club/team just didn’t look the same without him
              – Messidependencia was born.
            </p>
            <p>
              Two signings, however, would help the cause - Brazilian wonderkid
              Neymar in 2013, and Luis Suarez a year later. Another club treble
              in 2014/15, under new manager Luis Enrique, was no surprise – it
              followed the birth of the MSN, one of football’s most feared
              trios. The three South Americans complemented each other well
              on-the-field and became close friends off it. Lionel Messi got to
              embrace his winger days once again, dribbling past defenders with
              ease. However, the wonder years would soon end, and the dark ages
              would begin – starting off with consecutive European failures. But
              it was Neymar’s record-breaking transfer to PSG that started a
              domino, a catalyst of the club’s bad times. Mismanagement of
              funds, poor transfer policy paired with lucrative contracts,
              resultant financial troubles, and change of managers - everything
              had a toll on the club’s presence at the top of the footballing
              hierarchy.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the club went through an influx of changes over time, Messi
              remained the same. He was still the magician, dictating the attack
              upfront and amazing the audience. The 2018/19 season was the last
              season, when Messi was on god mode – nearly inspiring a third
              treble, but ultimately falling short. The new club captain
              couldn’t fulfill his promise of bringing back the Champions League
              to FC Barcelona. Another Ballon d’or just wasn’t enough for the
              number 10. Luis Suarez would end up in an ugly exit, after the 8-2
              thrashing at the hands of Bayern Munich. Lionel Messi was getting
              disappointed at the club he loved so much. Even the league title
              in Spain would become a Herculean task, and the club desperately
              held on. Lionel Messi would end up lifting the Copa del Rey title
              in the 2020-21 season, and the captain was jubilous, almost like a
              little kid. What he didn’t know, at the time, was that this
              particular trophy would be his last, as an FC Barcelona player.

              Yeah, these stats seem pretty good for the average footballer. But
              hey, since this is Lionel Messi the Alien we're dealing with, it's
              pretty obvious that he couldn't reach the standards he himself
              set, for an entire decade of ridiculous stats that seemed humanly
              impossible.

              Winning the league title in both seasons isn't really that big of
              an achievement for the cash-rich club. Zero Champions League
              titles won during Project Champions League led to the disbanding
              of the <abbr title="Mbappé, Neymar and Messi">MNM</abbr> trio.
              Even the wealthy Qatari ownership couldn't create an
              <abbr title="Messi, Suárez and Neymar">MSN</abbr> regen, let alone
              a decent side that could actually win the <b>Ol’ Big Ears</b>.

            <br />
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              Honestly, I've never watched a single game where Messi played for
              PSG, except his debut match (which was heartbreaking for the culer
              me). I've made sure to remain unbiased in my perspective of
              Messi's PSG stint, and I did watch his highlights regularly. His
              Opta-based scores were amazing in <b>Sorare</b>, which went on to
              prove that he was still good at what he did - play with the ball.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              <p>In an ideal world, Messi to PSG shouldn't have happened.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              He was ready to stay at FC Barcelona, reportedly accepting a 50%
              paycut, which was huge for someone of his caliber. His family was
              well-settled in the Catalan city, and Messi never really wanted to
              leave the club of his life (except in 2020, with the whole
              <a href="/src/error.html">burofax</a>
              fiasco). The Blaugrana geared up for the announcement of the
              much-expected renewal, but overnight, things changed dramatically.
              The renewal was impossible, and clubs swarmed Messi like vultures,
              although most of them couldn't really afford him. One club,
              however, could play the money card, and was always the actual
              favourite -
              <b>Manchester City</b>. Messi was already linked with City twice,
              in 2016 (due to the
              <a href="/src/error.html">tax evasion</a> controversy), and in
              2020, after the aforementioned burofax incident. Messi did have
              talks with <b>Pep Guardiola</b>, excited to join hands with his
              former manager at <b>Barça</b>. I too feel that Manchester City
              would have been a better destination, and these are my arguments -
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The <b>Premier League</b> is the most attractive top-flight
                league, ranked first by <b>UEFA</b> and being the most-watched
                league in the world.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Messi-Guardiola faction already yielded 14 trophies,
                including two Champions Leagues, and forming arguably the best
                footballing side of all time.
              </li>
              <li>
                Manchester City under Guardiola was a strict team system, with
                no place for individual shenanigans like at PSG. Messi's job
                would have been much easier in Guardiola's system.
              </li>
              <li>
                It would have been the perfect excuse to finally learn English.
                Sure, the weather and cuisine aren't the best, but a large part
                of Messi's global fanbase doesn't really understand what he
                speaks, without subtitles to save the day.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Yes, PSG made it to the UCL final in 2019/20. Neymar and Messi's
              reunion got a lot of people excited. Messi's second season was
              actually pretty good in terms of numbers. But, there's a lot of
              reasons that claim otherwise - the PSG transfer didn't really work
              out. His family had a hard time in France and he couldn't get the
              hero's welcome after winning the World Cup - Argentina beat France
              in the final, so a lot of fans were pissed back at the French
              capital. Besides, he didn't have the influence he enjoyed at
              Barça, let alone the love and the adoration.
