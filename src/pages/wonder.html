                <b>MNM - Mbappe, Neymar and Messi</b>. The deadliest trio in football was formed, atleast on paper, when the Argentine joined PSG. But how the hell did Messi decide to wear a shirt other than the striped Blaugrana?
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Well, FC Barcelona's financial troubles meant they couldn't renew the contract of their biggest star, who was set to stay. It was also reported that he was open to a big paycut, because he wasn't ready to prepare an emotional final speech. But hey, football can be cruel sometimes, but atleast he was signed by a club who doubled his weekly wages. He got to play with Neymar again, who powers of persuasion paid off. He started dreaming of winning the Champions League again, which was long overdue. With possibly the best third musketeer in Kylian Mbappe, and yet another summer of blockbuster signings, the dream was realistic.
            </p>
            <p>
                Messi in Paris was supposed to be a fairytale, but it never got to be written that way. Life after Barcelona was always bound to be hard, but it turned out to be on a higher difficulty mode. A poor first season by his standards, even though it was a good season for humanly standards, Messi just couldn't do it. In the league, he did have his moments, but on the biggest stage, the UEFA Champions League, he couldn't spew magic like he used to. This didn't go well with the fans, and Messi's ignorance of the ultras didn't help either. The greatest footballer in the modern era was being booed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second season was much better for Leo, but continental success still eluded PSG. The club didn't sign Messi for domestic dominance - they were already good in that, for years since the Qatari takeover. They wanted the UCL, to validate a long-term sporting project with enormous investment involved. Instead, they got Messi and longtime on-field rival Sergio Ramos getting all cuddly. A Saudi trip on working days was all that Messi had to do, to sever ties with the club. A suspension followed, and pretty soon, another ugly exit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lionel Messi's greatest achievement, whilst being a PSG player, was not at all related to the club at all. He got to win the World Cup, which surely cemented his place among the greats. His move to PSG initially meant that he could face his former club, Broke Barça, at the Champions League. But as destiny would have it, in both seasons Messi played for PSG, FC Barcelona would not make it to the round of 16 - they had to worry about the UEFA Europa League instead, a new low for them. PSG didn't even make it to the same group as FCB in those 2 seasons,  although Bayern Munich got that wish fulfilled, much to the dismay of the culers.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the difficult stay in France, and winning football's greatest prize, Messi decided to put family first, and seeked a new destination that made things easy. A return to Barcelona, although dreamy, was completely out of reach. Al Hilal had the opportunity to recreate a club rivalry, pitting Messi against Al Nassr's Cristiano Ronaldo. But Lionel Messi chose another destination, which wasn't unexpected, but yeah, his time at Europe was done and dusted. He was finally the GOAT, football's most decorated player, and he deserved some rest.

              Yeah, these stats seem pretty good for the average footballer. But hey, since this is Lionel Messi the Alien we're dealing with, it's pretty obvious that he couldn't reach the standards he himself set for an entire decade.

              </ul>
              <p>
                Winning the league title in both seasons isn't really that big of an achievement, because PSG could do it without Messi. Zero Champions League titles won during Project Champions League led to the disbanding of the MNM trio. Even the wealthy Qatari ownership couldn't create an MSN regen, let alone a decent side that could actually win the Ol’ Big Ears.
