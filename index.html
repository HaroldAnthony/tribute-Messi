        The whole purpose behind the creation of this heavily-bootstrapped
        webpage, and the crazy mind behind all this glazing.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        <strong>SHORT STORY</strong> - I'm a college graduate, looking for an
        excuse to sharpen my Bootstrap skills (just effective copy-pasting).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>LONG STORY</strong> - I've been crazy about football since 2011,
        and being an ardent follower of FC Barcelona sucks, atleast in 2024.
        What sucks even more is the fact that I'm not able to land a job, maybe
        because it is 2024. But hey, my favourite footballer just completed a
        three-peat of major international trophies, so it's not that bad. Well,
        it's not like he's aging backward, and he might retire before the
        potential <strong><em>Finalissima</em></strong> clash with Boy Wonder Lamine Yamal and the <strong><em>La
          Roja</em></strong>. But again, I'm going through a lot of emotions, and this site is
        where all the rambling will go on.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong><em>Blaugrana</em></strong> just aren't the same without their all-time top scorer,
        who left amidst the club's financial trouble (and apparently, because of
        it!). Laporta did return as club president, and a plethora of big free
        agent signings did follow, but we still unearthed a lot of <strong><em>La Masia</em></strong> gems
        in the process. The latest one is the aforementioned Boy Wonder Lamine
        Yamal (that's how I'll keep calling him), but others have contributed
        greatly as well, including Fermín López, who was part of the UEFA EURO
        2024 winning squad with Yamal, and Pau Cubarsí, who missed out. If I can
        include EURO-winning La Masia graduates who don't play for FC Barcelona,
        namely Marc Cucurella, Dani Olmo, and Alex Grimaldo (who was nowhere to
        be seen at the Euro, but had a fantastic season with <strong>Bayer Neverlusen</strong>),
        it is self-explanatory that La Masia is still the best at what it does.
        But the youth academy's greatest graduate is still greatly missed.
      </p>

        Argentina got to keep hold of their captain for longer, and
        coincidentally, it was after his last-ever game with FC Barcelona that
        he finally got to win international trophies. Maybe it was meant to be
        that way, starting with the 2021 Copa América, and moving on to the 2022
        FIFA World Cup and the 2024 Copa América, completing the international
        three-peat. 2021 saw Argentina's <strong><em>capitán</em></strong> finally shrug off the criticism
        that he couldn't win big with the <strong><em>La Albiceleste</em></strong>, and that he always
        felt Catalan instead. Winning the oldest still-running continental
        football competition at the Maracanã, against fierce rivals Brazil, felt
        like destiny, although this was just the start. He would go on to be the
        best player of the 2022 World Cup, apart from being the winning captain,
        and whilst 2024's Copa América didn't go as well stat-wise, the team won
        gold again, and gave him perhaps his last hurrah.
      </p>

        <strong><em>"La Pulga"</em></strong> currently plies his trade at Inter Miami CF, which is the
        newest holiday destination for his Barcelona comrades Luis Suárez,
        Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba. I didn't bother watching him in PSG, his
        next club after getting discarded from <strong><em>Barça</em></strong>, simply because I couldn't
        see him in in another club jersey than the accustomed <strong>blue and garnet</strong>.
        It must be pretty clear by now that I didn't watch him in pink as well,
        rather choosing to recover all that lost sleep over the years. His
        <strong>Sorare</strong> scores were still amazing, but he missed a handful of games,
        owing to fatigue and injury problems, which did prove that he was just
        as human like most post-prime footballers. Atleast I thought so, because
        watching him still reminds of yesteryear glimpses - the passing, the created
        chances, the occasional dribbles, and that damned walking. He's still
        the greatest of all time, albeit the grayed hairs.
      </p>
      <p>
        This wannabe webpage is going to be all about THAT sportsperson, and why
        I've been amazed by watching his magic unfold (no pun intended).
